        <h1>That's it (for now) - Farewell from bitswap</h1>
        <p>Dear valued customers,</p>
        <p>It's with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of bitswap. This project has been an incredible journey for us, and we are immensely grateful for the opportunity to serve you.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we've reached a point where continuing is no longer feasible. While it's a difficult decision, we believe it's the right one given the circumstances.</p>
        <p>We want to express our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. We truly wish things could have turned out differently.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, feedback, or simply want to reminisce about our time together, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:yannpiot+bitswap@gmail.com">yannpiot+bitswap@gmail.com</a>. We'd love to hear from you one last time.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your support, understanding, and for being part of the bitswap community. Though this chapter may be closing, we hope our paths cross again in the future.</p>
        <p>Warm regards,</p>
        <p>The bitswap Team</p>
